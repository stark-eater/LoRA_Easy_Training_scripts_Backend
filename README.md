**This backend implements Bluvoll's fork of sd-scripts (or sd_scripts, if you like) for training in [NoobAI XL Rectified flow models](https://civitai.com/models/2071356/experimental-noobai-with-rectified-flow-eq-vae) through submodule.**

Make sure you run sd-scripts/venv/python -m pip install "numpy<2" after a successful installation, since some components that have been compiled with Numpy 1.x cannot run with Numpy 2.x.

Numpy 2.x will get replaced with Numpy 1.x, and the program will work properly.
